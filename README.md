# Machine Learning
This is a collection of videos covering machine learning and AI.

## M1: The Perceptron: Worked Example
We discuss the perceptron using a worked example. Many argue that the perceptron was one of the first machine-learning algorithms. Initially, the maths looks a bit scary. However, after working through a few rounds of updating, the algorithm makes sense.

## M2: The Perceptron: Implementation in Python
We implement the perceptron in Python. This is our first machine-learning algorithm, and we will explore the iteration process in detail. The perceptron learns from making mistakes, which affect subsequent weights of inputs.

## M3: An Introduction to Scikit-Learn
Scikit-Learn offers a wide range of Python implementations of machine-learning tools (https://scikit-learn.org/). In addition, you have access to datasets for training and testing. Many examples illustrate the use of machine-learning applications in practice.

## M4: Logistic Regression in Scikit-Learn
We use Sci-kit Learn to conduct a logistic regression analysis. The implementation is straightforward. We will interpret and visualise the results.

## M5: Principal Component Analysis in Scikit-Learn
We conduct a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using Scikit-Learn. PCA is an unsupervised machine-learning tool, i.e., we do not provide any labels or guidance and let the machine explore the data. PCA is used to reduce a dataset's dimensions without losing essential information.
